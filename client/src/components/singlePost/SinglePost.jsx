                Nature, in the broadest sense, is the physical world or universe.
                "Nature" can refer to the phenomena of the physical world, 
                and also to life in general. The study of nature is a large, 
                if not the only, part of science. Although humans are part of nature, 
                human activity is often understood as a separate category from other 
                natural phenomena.
